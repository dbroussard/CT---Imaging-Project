Meeting notes:
David and Jason discussed a validation script that David built out to confirm that the Windows updates processes won't be triggered or remediated or brought back into the mix. The script goes through a computer that's been imaged, it imports the set of asset files, imports a set of audit and security policies and configurations.
	David presented a validation script to confirm that the Windows updates processes won't be triggered or remediated. The script goes through a computer that's been imaged, imports the set of asset files, imports a set of audit and security policies and configurations.
	David presented a script that would be performed by the hardware team or a vendor to set up the computers and images them.
	Jason and David discussed a script that would prevent updates on computers. David explained that the script runs before Windows loads and is configured to run every time the computer restarts.
	Jason, Omar and David discussed a solution to prevent updates from occurring on a computer. They decided to set up a task to run at midnight or early in the morning to delete the services. The script that they are writing is usable across any Windows devices.
	David and Jason discussed the Golden Group policy rules and settings. David explained that the configurations are based on the setup document and will reapply the settings remotely through the script.
David, Jason and Omar discussed the process of creating an image for devices. They agreed that a script would be used to standardize the imaging process and ensure consistency across different hardware types. The script will apply configurations and settings in the same way as manual configuration, but it is not dependent on specific hardware.
	David and Jason discussed the difference between imaging and using a script to configure computers. David explained that imaging is not always consistent, especially when applying it across different types of hardware. The script method is more consistent and independent of specific hardware.
	Jason and Omar were discussing the benefits of using a script to automate the process of setting up new devices. Omar explained that the script would eliminate the need for manual steps and ensure consistency across all devices.
	Omar and Jason discussed the process of creating and deploying images. They agreed that the process should remain the same, but with added mediation for Windows Update and validation at the end.
	David and Omar discussed the consistency of the imaging process and how to standardize it. David proposed a script that would ensure consistency across any platform and imaging software. The script would apply the same settings and drivers to any device, regardless of hardware deviations or imaging software.
	Jason and Omar discussed the image testing with Dell computers. They have been working on an image based on David's script for the last couple of months.
Jason and David discussed the need for MDM in all cases and the possibility of using a cheaper vendor, Cole Manage Engine. Omar is waiting for a quote from them. Jason also mentioned the need for a hardware confirmation form and Nina will work on that.
	Jason, David and Omar discussed the need for MDM in all cases and the possibility of using a cheaper vendor, Cole Manage Engine, that can do all the required tasks in one platform. David explained that the MDM is necessary for the auto-healing feature to work.
	Jason informed the team that they can't choose a locked versus unlocked device at the time of the proposal. He is working with legal to update the statement of work text to make it flexible and have both options in there.
	Jason and David discussed the security risks associated with unlocked devices and the need for a sponsor decision. They also talked about the importance of device updates and control. Nina asked about differences in imaged devices.
	David expressed concern about small deviations in settings, specifically the background wallpaper on the base image.
Jason and David discussed the process of creating a stable image for devices, with the goal of having a fully locked device with the script. They discussed the possibility of having both an unlocked and locked image for each device, depending on the sponsor's preference.
	Nina and Jason discussed the process of purchasing new HP computers from a new vendor, Insight, and how they had to be reimaged by QUIPMENT due to the Windows Update Medic issue. They noted that the scripts idea is now in place to solve the issue.
	Jason proposed to get a fully locked device and test it to ensure the measurement quality. They discussed maintaining both an unlocked image and a locked image for each device so that they could apply either method depending on the way that sponsor wants to go.
	David and Jason discussed a setup script to apply group policy settings to a fresh install of Windows 11. The script would allow them to remove unwanted apps, lock down the computer, and capture the image for subsequent machines.
	David proposed a plan to have a checkpoint system in place to allow for changes midway through the process.
Nina, David and Omar discussed the details of the script for setting up computers. They agreed to use a script instead of manual setup and discussed the process for applying it to the next round of computers. Omar will get pricing on the MDM for Windows computers and share that with the team.
	Nina discussed the need for a more detailed meeting to move forward with scripting setup instead of manual setup. Omar will get pricing on the MDM for Windows computers and share that with the team.
	Omar, Nina and Gabe discussed locking down USB and allowing only keyboard and mouse. They also talked about the details of the script and when to have the next meeting. David will be owning the process and will have something presentable for the next meeting.
	Omar and Jason discussed the importance of validating the golden image to ensure that everything applied to the image is also applied to the other one.
	David presented the entire setup process, which includes manual processes, generalization, and image capture. The next script is the validation script that Rudy will run to ensure that the settings are applied correctly.
	Nina and Omar discussed the MDM script process and how it can be modified to add missing elements. David expressed his appreciation for the good work and questions.
